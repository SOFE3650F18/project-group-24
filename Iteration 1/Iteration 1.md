### Step 3 - Choose one or more Elements to refine
The element to refine is the entire CMS system

### Step 4 - Choose one or more design concepts to work with
| Design Decisions and Location | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Logically structure the client part of the system using Web application |  |
| Logically structure the server part of the system using service application |  |
| Physically structure the application using the three tiered deployment pattern |  |
